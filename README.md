In this project I aimed to create a website which could show changes in music over the last 50+ years. I really wanted to do this project because I really like music and was interested in its development over time.

While I was working, I had to make several compromises due to my inadequacy. Originally, I had hoped to implement the Time Magazine Person of the Year cover for each year into this project. I had also hoped to have each datapoint clickable to reveal a link to the song's streaming source.

However, despite these issues with the project, when the data is carefully visualized layer by layer, I think that it is a pretty good looking visualization.

Technically -- I would say that my project is successful, it does its intended purpose of showing trends in music over the last 50 years. However, its method of doing so is a little lackluster so I am still disappointed despite the project realizing its initial goal.

If I had more time on this project, I would go back and add the things that I discussed above as well as add the top songs for each attribute in the attribute section.
